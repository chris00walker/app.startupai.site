# Observability

- Tracing: OpenTelemetry; propagate context across services; sample rates tuned per SLO.
- Metrics: Prometheus format endpoint; RED/USE metrics; custom quality/cost gauges.
- Logging: JSON structured logs; request IDs; PII-safe logging policy.
- Dashboards: Predefined views for latency, error rate, cost per canvas.
