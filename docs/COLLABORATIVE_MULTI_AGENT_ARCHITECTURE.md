# Collaborative Multi-Agent Canvas Architecture
## True OpenAI-Style Multi-Agent Collaboration for Strategyzer Consulting

### Overview

This architecture transforms the sequential pipeline into a **true collaborative multi-agent system** where agents work simultaneously on shared canvases, debate findings, iterate on each other's work, and run simulations together.

### 2. Agent Communication Protocol

```javascript
class AgentCommunication {
  async sendMessage(fromAgent, toAgent, message, canvasId) {
    return {
      id: "msg_uuid",
      from: fromAgent,
      to: toAgent,
      message: message,
      canvasId: canvasId,
      timestamp: new Date(),
      type: "debate" | "question" | "suggestion" | "challenge"
    };
  }
  
  async broadcastToTeam(fromAgent, message, canvasId) {
    // Send to all agents working on this canvas
  }
  
  async initiateDebate(topic, participants, canvasId) {
    // Start structured debate between agents
  }
}
```

### 3. Collaborative Agent Runner

```javascript
class CollaborativeAgentOrchestrator {
  constructor() {
    this.activeCanvases = new Map();
    this.agentTeams = new Map();
    this.debateManager = new DebateManager();
  }
  
  async startCollaborativeSession(canvasType, clientId) {
    // 1. Create shared canvas
    const canvas = await this.createSharedCanvas(canvasType, clientId);
    
    // 2. Assemble agent team
    const team = this.assembleAgentTeam(canvasType);
    
    // 3. Start collaborative work
    return this.orchestrateCollaboration(canvas, team);
  }
  
  async orchestrateCollaboration(canvas, team) {
    // Agents work simultaneously on different canvas sections
    const workPromises = team.map(agent => 
      this.startAgentWork(agent, canvas)
    );
    
    // Monitor for conflicts and debates
    this.monitorCollaboration(canvas, team);
    
    // Run simulation cycles
    this.scheduleSimulations(canvas);
    
    return canvas;
  }
  
  async handleAgentDebate(debate) {
    // Facilitate structured debate between agents
    // Let them argue, present evidence, reach consensus
  }
}
```

## Collaboration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Customer Segment Debate
1. **Customer Discovery Agent** identifies "Small businesses" as primary segment
2. **Market Research Agent** challenges: "Enterprise has 10x revenue potential"
3. **Simulation Agent** runs models for both segments
4. **Critique Agent** questions assumptions in both analyses
5. **Validation Agent** designs experiments to test both hypotheses
6. **Team reaches consensus** based on evidence and simulations

### Scenario 2: Value Proposition Iteration
1. **Value Proposition Agent** proposes solution features
2. **Customer Discovery Agent** validates against customer jobs
3. **Simulation Agent** tests financial viability
4. **Business Model Agent** questions scalability
5. **Agents iterate together** until solution is validated

### Scenario 3: Canvas Quality Assurance
1. **All agents** populate their sections
2. **Critique Agent** identifies inconsistencies
3. **Simulation Agent** finds unrealistic assumptions
4. **Team debates and refines** until canvas is coherent

---

## Benefits of Collaborative Architecture

1. **Higher Quality Output**: Multiple perspectives and validation
2. **Reduced Bias**: Agents challenge each other's assumptions
3. **Realistic Solutions**: Simulations test viability in real-time
4. **Iterative Improvement**: Continuous refinement through collaboration
5. **Comprehensive Analysis**: No blind spots due to multiple viewpoints
6. **Client-Ready Artifacts**: Thoroughly vetted and validated canvases

This architecture transforms the platform from a simple pipeline into a **sophisticated consulting team** where AI agents truly collaborate, debate, and iterate together - just like human consultants working on strategic projects.
