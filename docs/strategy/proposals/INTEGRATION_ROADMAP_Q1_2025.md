2. Evidence accumulates in gate evaluation
   ↓
3. Gate passes (sufficient evidence + quality)
   ↓
4. Integration triggers available:
   - Export to Cursor (.cursorrules)
   - Generate UI (v0.dev)
   - Generate DB schema (Supabase)
   - Enable offline (ElectricSQL)

## 🚨 Risk Management

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| v0 API unavailable | Medium | High | Use web automation fallback |
| ElectricSQL complexity | High | Medium | Phase 3 optional, defer if needed |
| Integration APIs change | Medium | Medium | Abstract layer + adapters |
| AI generation quality | Medium | Medium | Human review + refinement UI |

### Business Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| "Just middleware" perception | Medium | High | Emphasize validation intelligence |
| Users prefer all-in-one | Low | Medium | Explain ecosystem benefits |
| Integration partners compete | Low | High | Own the validation layer |
| Pricing complexity | Medium | Low | Simple tiers, clear value |

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **v0 API Risk:**
   - Plan A: Official v0 API (if available)
   - Plan B: Web automation (Playwright)
   - Plan C: Template-based generation
   - Plan D: Partner with other UI tools (Builder.io)

2. **ElectricSQL Risk:**
   - Start with cloud-first (existing)
   - Add ElectricSQL as Phase 3
   - Can defer to Month 4-5 if needed
   - Alternative: PGlite for simpler local-first

3. **Quality Risk:**
   - Add review step before export
   - Allow manual editing of generated artifacts
   - Provide "Regenerate" option
   - Show confidence scores

4. **Positioning Risk:**
   - Lead with validation (core value)
   - Frame integrations as "bonus"
   - Emphasize business intelligence layer
   - Show before/after examples (generic AI vs StartupAI)
