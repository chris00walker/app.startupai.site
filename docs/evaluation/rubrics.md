# Evaluation Rubrics & Benchmarks

## Fields & Scoring

- CTR by channel/vertical
- CPC ceiling
- CVR to intent
- Price elasticity delta
- Evidence quality score
- Risk notes
- Pass when ≥3 converging signals meet thresholds; otherwise yellow/red with rationale.

## Evidence Quality Score

- Definition: Composite metric for source credibility, recency, traceability, and evaluator agreement.
- Range: 0–100.
- Default pass threshold: ≥ 75 for export-related decisions (tune per vertical/preset).
- Inputs: citation count/quality, provenance flags, reproducibility, human review notes.
- Operationalization: log per artifact with correlation IDs and rationale; include in client deliverables.

## Vertical Presets & Benchmark Deltas

### Specialty Food Distribution (DTC + B2B)

- CTR: +0.2–0.4% vs. baseline when creative shows provenance/quality badges.
- CPC ceiling: 10–20% higher acceptable due to niche targeting; prioritize ROAS proxies.
- CVR to intent: expect 1.8–2.5% on DTC waitlist; B2B form-fill 1.0–1.8%.
- Notes: emphasize compliance (FDA/labeling), cold-chain claims, allergens. Evidence weight ↑ for trust signals.

### Insurance Brokers/Agents (independent; online workflows)

- CTR: baseline or slightly below (−0.2%) due to regulated language; rely on precise audience.
- CPC ceiling: tighter caps; optimize for qualified lead cost, not raw CTR.
- CVR to intent: form start 3–5%, completion 1–2% with simplified flows.
- Notes: strict compliance copy; PII handling flagged; evaluator requires explicit safety checks.

### Brick‑and‑Mortar → eCommerce (omnichannel transition)

- CTR: +0.3% with local intent and store pickup messaging.
- CPC ceiling: baseline; leverage geo and LTV uplift.
- CVR to intent: 2.0–3.0% when click & collect is offered.
- Notes: inventory and fulfillment feasibility affect pass/fail; evaluator adds ops‑risk modifier.

### eCommerce Solopreneurs (idea stage; limited signal)

- CTR: wide variance; accept exploratory range; focus on message-market fit.
- CPC ceiling: strict; protect budget with small pulses.
- CVR to intent: 1.0–2.0% acceptable if converging signals present across variants.
- Notes: emphasize iterative probes; pass requires trend improvement across 2–3 cycles rather than absolute levels.
