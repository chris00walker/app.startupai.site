  main_questions:
    - "Who do you believe would be most excited about your solution?"
    - "What specific group of people face the problem you're solving?"
    - "If you could only serve one type of customer initially, who would that be?"
    
  follow_up_variations:

```

### 2.2 Problem Definition Templates

```

## 3. Response Validation and Follow-up Logic

### 3.1 Response Quality Assessment

```yaml
response_evaluation_criteria:
  clarity:
    high: "Response is specific, detailed, and easy to understand"
    medium: "Response provides good information but could be clearer"
    low: "Response is vague, confusing, or lacks detail"
    
  completeness:
    complete: "Response fully addresses the question asked"
    partial: "Response addresses some aspects but misses key elements"
    insufficient: "Response doesn't adequately address the question"
    
  consistency:
    consistent: "Response aligns with previous answers and logical flow"
    minor_conflict: "Small inconsistencies that can be clarified"
    major_conflict: "Significant contradictions requiring resolution"
```

### 3.2 Follow-up Question Logic

**For Unclear Responses:**
```yaml
clarity_improvement:
  gentle_prompting:
    - "That's interesting. Can you help me understand what you mean by [specific term]?"
    - "I want to make sure I'm following correctly. When you say [concept], are you referring to [clarification]?"
    - "Could you give me a specific example of [unclear concept]?"
    
  example_provision:
    - "Let me give you an example to help clarify what I'm looking for..."
    - "For instance, if you were solving [similar problem], you might say [example response]."
    - "Some entrepreneurs in similar situations have described it as [example]."
```

**For Incomplete Responses:**
```yaml
completeness_improvement:
  gentle_expansion:
    - "That's a great start. Can you tell me more about [missing element]?"
    - "I'd love to understand [specific aspect] in more detail."
    - "What about [missing component] - how does that factor in?"
    
  guided_exploration:
    - "Let's explore [missing area] together. Have you considered [specific aspect]?"
    - "Building on what you shared, what about [related question]?"
    - "That covers [covered area] well. Now I'm curious about [uncovered area]."
```

**For Contradictory Responses:**
```yaml
consistency_resolution:
  gentle_clarification:
    - "I want to make sure I understand correctly. Earlier you mentioned [previous response], and now you're saying [current response]. Can you help me understand how these connect?"
    - "I'm noticing some different perspectives in your responses. Let's clarify [specific contradiction]."
    - "It sounds like there might be multiple aspects to consider here. Can you help me understand [conflicting elements]?"
```

### 3.3 Adaptive Questioning Strategies

**For Confident, Detailed Responders:**
```yaml
advanced_user_strategy:
  approach: "Ask deeper, more strategic questions"
  question_style: "Framework-based and analytical"
  examples:
    - "How does this align with your go-to-market strategy?"
    - "What assumptions are you making about customer acquisition costs?"
    - "How have you validated product-market fit indicators?"
```

**For Uncertain or Struggling Responders:**
```yaml
supportive_user_strategy:
  approach: "Provide more guidance and examples"
  question_style: "Simpler, more concrete questions"
  examples:
    - "Let's start with what you know for sure..."
    - "Think about someone you know who has this problem..."
    - "If you had to guess, what would you say?"
```

## 4. Handling Unclear or Incomplete Answers

### 4.1 Recognition Patterns

**Unclear Response Indicators:**
```yaml
unclear_response_signals:
  linguistic_markers:
    - excessive use of "maybe," "I think," "probably"
    - vague terms like "people," "everyone," "lots of"
    - circular explanations that don't add clarity
    - technical jargon without explanation
    
  content_markers:
    - answers that don't address the specific question
    - responses that are too broad or too narrow
    - contradictory statements within the same response
    - lack of concrete examples or evidence
```

**Incomplete Response Indicators:**
```yaml
incomplete_response_signals:
  missing_elements:
    - customer segment without demographics
    - problem description without impact assessment
    - solution explanation without differentiation
    - resource assessment without specific constraints
    
  surface_level_responses:
    - one-sentence answers to complex questions
    - generic responses that could apply to any business
    - lack of personal insight or experience
    - missing emotional or motivational context
```

### 4.2 Recovery Strategies

**Clarification Techniques:**
```yaml
clarification_approaches:
  reframing:
    - "Let me ask this differently..."
    - "Another way to think about this is..."
    - "What if I put it this way..."
    
  example_driven:
    - "For example, imagine a customer who..."
    - "Let's say you're talking to a potential customer..."
    - "Picture this scenario..."
    
  component_breakdown:
    - "Let's break this into smaller pieces..."
    - "There are a few parts to this question..."
    - "We can tackle this step by step..."
```

**Encouragement and Support:**
```yaml
supportive_responses:
  validation:
    - "That's a thoughtful response. Let's dig a bit deeper..."
    - "I can see you're thinking carefully about this..."
    - "You're on the right track. Can you help me understand..."
    
  normalization:
    - "This is often the hardest question for entrepreneurs..."
    - "Many founders struggle with this aspect initially..."
    - "It's completely normal to feel uncertain about..."
    
  progress_acknowledgment:
    - "We're making great progress understanding your business..."
    - "You've given me excellent insights so far..."
    - "This conversation is really helping clarify..."
```
