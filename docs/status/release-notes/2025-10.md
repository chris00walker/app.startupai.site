# Release Notes â€“ October 2025

## Highlights

- Applied Supabase migrations (`00008-00010`) enabling onboarding session storage and entrepreneur briefs.
- Deployed onboarding wizard with staged AI responses; full CrewAI integration targeted for November.
- Split marketing/app docs; published public exports for marketing contracts.

## Fixes & Improvements

- Hardened OAuth callback to set sessions even when marketing lacks service role key (fallback to user client).
- Added logging + cache for onboarding message dedupe and retry.
- Refined PostHog events (`onboarding_stage_advanced`, `crewai_workflow_*`).

## Ops Notes

- Production migrations executed via `supabase db push --include-all` (recorded in CLI history).
- Netlify deploy `#415` promoted; rollback target `#414`.
