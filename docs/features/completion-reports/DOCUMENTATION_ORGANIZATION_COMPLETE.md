## 📁 Strategic Documents (Kept in Root)

**Active Planning Documents - Remain Accessible:**
- ✅ EXECUTIVE_DECISION_SUMMARY.md
- ✅ INTEGRATION_BRIDGE_STRATEGY.md
- ✅ STRATEGIC_FRAMEWORKS_CORE.md
- ✅ MVP_INTEGRATION_ROADMAP.md
- ✅ INTEGRATION_ROADMAP_Q1_2025.md

**Rationale:** These are actively referenced planning documents, not historical completion reports.
