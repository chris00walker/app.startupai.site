# SLOs and Budgets

- API: p95 latency ≤ 3s; error rate < 1%.
- Renderer: p95 latency ≤ 8s; error rate < 1%.
- End-to-End Canvas: ≤ 30s p95.
- Database: Average query latency < 100ms; p95 < 300ms.
- Cost: ≤ $2 per complete canvas; alerts at 50/80/100% of monthly budget.
- Error Budgets: 1% error budget per service; rollout pauses when exceeded.
