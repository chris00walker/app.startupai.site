## üîÑ Advanced Orchestration Patterns

### 1. **Collaborative Workflows**
```javascript
// Example: Market Research Agent informs Customer Interview Agent
MarketResearchAgent.complete() ‚Üí 
  CustomerInterviewAgent.updateTargetSegments(marketInsights) ‚Üí
  PersonaDevelopmentAgent.refinePersonas(interviewData)
```

### 2. **Feedback Loops**
```javascript
// Example: Customer validation informs market strategy
CustomerValidationAgent.results() ‚Üí 
  if (lowProductMarketFit) {
    trigger: CustomerDiscoveryAgent.deepDive()
  } else {
    trigger: ScalingAgent.accelerate()
  }
```

### 3. **Dynamic Re-prioritization**
```javascript
// Example: Market changes trigger strategy revision
MarketMonitoringAgent.detectChange() ‚Üí
  StrategicPlanningAgent.reassessStrategy() ‚Üí
  AllAgents.updatePriorities(newStrategy)
```

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Architecture

### 1. **Agent Orchestration Engine**
```javascript
class ConsultingOrchestrator {
  constructor() {
    this.agents = new Map();
    this.workflows = new Map();
    this.artifactGenerator = new ArtifactGenerator();
    this.collaborationEngine = new CollaborationEngine();
  }

  async executeConsultingEngagement(client, objectives) {
    // Phase 1: Customer Discovery
    const discoveryResults = await this.executePhase('discovery', {
      agents: ['MarketResearchAgent', 'CustomerInterviewAgent', 'PersonaAgent'],
      collaboration: 'sequential_with_feedback',
      artifacts: ['market_analysis', 'customer_personas', 'journey_map']
    });

    // Phase 2: Customer Validation (informed by discovery)
    const validationResults = await this.executePhase('validation', {
      agents: ['MVPAgent', 'BusinessModelAgent', 'GTMAgent'],
      inputs: discoveryResults,
      collaboration: 'parallel_with_synthesis',
      artifacts: ['mvp_spec', 'business_model_canvas', 'gtm_plan']
    });

    // Continue with scaling and optimization...
  }
}
```

### 2. **Intelligent Artifact Generator**
```javascript
class ArtifactGenerator {
  async generateBusinessModelCanvas(businessData) {
    const canvas = await this.createInteractiveSVG({
      template: 'business_model_canvas',
      data: businessData,
      styling: 'professional',
      interactivity: ['hover_details', 'edit_mode', 'export_options']
    });
    
    return {
      artifact: canvas,
      metadata: {
        type: 'business_model_canvas',
        generatedBy: 'BusinessModelAgent',
        lastUpdated: new Date(),
        version: '1.0'
      }
    };
  }
}
```

### 3. **Collaboration Engine**
```javascript
class CollaborationEngine {
  async facilitateAgentCollaboration(agents, collaborationType) {
    switch(collaborationType) {
      case 'sequential_with_feedback':
        return await this.sequentialExecution(agents);
      case 'parallel_with_synthesis':
        return await this.parallelWithSynthesis(agents);
      case 'iterative_refinement':
        return await this.iterativeRefinement(agents);
    }
  }
}
