### 2.2 Sample AI Conversation Flow

**Opening Introduction:**
```
AI: "Hi! I'm your AI Strategy Consultant. I'm here to guide you through a structured conversation that will help us understand your startup idea and create a comprehensive validation plan.

Over the next 20-25 minutes, I'll ask you questions about your customers, the problem you're solving, your solution approach, and your resources. This will give us everything we need to generate a detailed strategic analysis with specific recommendations.

Are you ready to begin? This works best when you can focus without distractions."
```

**Customer Segment Discovery:**
```
AI: "Let's start with your customers. Who do you believe would be most excited about your solution?"

[User responds: "Small restaurant owners who struggle with inventory management"]

AI: "Great! Restaurant owners face many operational challenges. When you say 'small restaurant owners,' can you be more specific? Are we talking about independent restaurants, small chains, specific cuisine types, or restaurants in particular locations?"

[User provides more detail]

AI: "Perfect. Now, what specific inventory management problems do these restaurant owners face? Is it overstocking, understocking, waste management, or something else?"
```

**Problem Validation:**
```
AI: "You mentioned inventory management challenges. Help me understand - how painful is this problem for restaurant owners? What happens when they get inventory wrong?"

[User explains impact]

AI: "That's a significant problem. On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate the pain level of this problem for restaurant owners? And how frequently does this problem occur?"
```

### 2.3 AI Response Patterns

**Acknowledgment Patterns:**
- "That's a great insight about..."
- "I can see you've thought deeply about..."
- "That's exactly the kind of detail that will help us..."

**Clarification Patterns:**
- "Help me understand what you mean by..."
- "Can you give me a specific example of..."
- "When you say X, are you referring to..."

**Transition Patterns:**
- "Now that we understand your customers, let's explore..."
- "Building on what you've shared about the problem..."
- "This connects well to what we discussed earlier about..."
