# eCommerce Validation Workflow (Online‑Only)

This workflow focuses on fast, low-cost validation using only online experiments.

- Intake (5 questions) → select eCommerce policy preset via Policy Router
- Plan: choose experiments (smoke page, fake door, price probe, paid pulse, matrix, checkout emu)
- Execute: run online experiments only; collect metrics
- Evaluate: rubric benchmarks by vertical (CTR, CPC, CVR to intent, price elasticity delta, evidence score)
- Decide: Green/Yellow/Red + next 3 actions
- Deliver: one‑page plan + evidence pack; versioned artifacts with lineage
