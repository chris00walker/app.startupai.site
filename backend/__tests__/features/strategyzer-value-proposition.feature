Feature: Strategyzer Value Proposition Design
  As a business strategist following Alex Osterwalder's methodology
  I want to create comprehensive Value Proposition Canvases
  So that I can design products and services that create customer value

  Background:
    Given the Strategyzer AI platform is operational
    And I have customer discovery data available
    And the Value Proposition Canvas agent is configured

  Scenario: Generate complete Value Proposition Canvas
    Given I have customer jobs, pains, and gains identified
    When I request a Value Proposition Canvas generation
    Then the agent should create a customer profile section
    And the agent should create a value map section
    And the customer profile should list all customer jobs
    And the customer profile should list all customer pains
    And the customer profile should list all customer gains
    And the value map should propose relevant products and services
    And the value map should suggest pain relievers for each pain
    And the value map should suggest gain creators for each gain
    And the canvas should be exportable as structured data

  Scenario: Value Proposition Canvas validation and iteration
    Given I have an initial Value Proposition Canvas
    When I run validation experiments
    Then the agent should suggest testable hypotheses
    And the agent should recommend experiment designs
    And the agent should provide success metrics
    And the agent should suggest iteration strategies
    And all recommendations should follow Testing Business Ideas methodology

  Scenario: Visual canvas generation for client presentation
    Given I have a complete Value Proposition Canvas data structure
    When I request visual canvas generation
    Then the system should create a client-ready visual canvas
    And the canvas should follow Strategyzer design standards
    And the canvas should be exportable in multiple formats
    And the canvas should include proper branding and styling
