# Feature Template

Each feature folder should include:

- `feature.md` – Scope, acceptance criteria, risks.
- `test-plan.md` – Critical scenarios, automation coverage.
- `checklist.md` – Migrations, flags, docs, analytics.
- `delivery-notes.md` – Release summary, links to PRs/issues.

Example structure:

```
work/features/onboarding-crewai/
  feature.md
  test-plan.md
  checklist.md
  delivery-notes.md
```
