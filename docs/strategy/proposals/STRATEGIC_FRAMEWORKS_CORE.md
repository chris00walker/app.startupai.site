## üß≠ Strategic Positioning

### What StartupAI Is:
**A strategic business design platform** that helps founders and consultants:
1. Design and test business models (Osterwalder)
2. Craft winning competitive strategies (Martin)
3. Create blue ocean opportunities (Kim & Mauborgne)
4. Use AI-assisted frameworks for faster, better strategic thinking

### What StartupAI Is NOT:
- ‚ùå Just a "validation tool"
- ‚ùå Just a "Business Model Canvas app"
- ‚ùå A code generation platform (that's execution, not strategy)
- ‚ùå A generic AI assistant

### The Core Differentiator:
**Strategic frameworks + AI assistance + Creative artifacts + Execution pipeline**
