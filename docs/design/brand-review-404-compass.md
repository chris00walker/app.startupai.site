## Brand Compliance Checklist

### Color Compliance: PASS

| Color Used | Hex (approx) | Brand Match |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Teal/Cyan | #2dd4bf | Accent color - validation/growth |
| Navy/Dark Blue | #1a365d | Close to brand foreground |
| White | #ffffff | Background/contrast |

The illustration uses the brand teal prominently, which aligns with our accent color (hsl 160, 84%, 39%). The navy provides appropriate contrast and echoes the primary blue family.

### Style Consistency: PASS

- **Geometric**: Strong use of circles, lines, and angular shapes
- **Minimalist**: Limited color palette, clean composition
- **No photorealism**: Abstract representation, not literal
- **No gradients**: Flat color fills throughout

### Emotional Tone: PASS

The compass metaphor conveys:
- **Guidance**: "We'll help you find your way"
- **Direction**: Purpose and navigation
- **Not punitive**: Helpful rather than frustrating
- **Professional**: Sophisticated, not childish

### Technical Quality: PASS

- **No text baked in**: Clean illustration without embedded text
- **Scalable**: Vector-based design
- **Appropriate complexity**: Detailed but not overwhelming

## Brand Guidelines Reference

From `frontend/src/styles/globals.css`:

```css
/* Primary: Strategic blue - trust, action */

/* Accent: Validation/growth */
--accent: 160 84% 39%;

/* Foreground: Professional dark */
--foreground: 220 30% 10%;

The illustration successfully incorporates these brand values through its color choices and visual language.
