# Database Utilities

This directory holds database tooling for the StartupAI product app.

## Seeding

Seeding is intentionally disabled. The platform should not create synthetic or placeholder data.

Use one of the following instead:
- Real onboarding flows in the product UI
- Supabase Studio (Table Editor)
- Migration scripts (Drizzle)

If you need development data, create it through the normal product workflows so the UI reflects real database state.
