## üéØ What You're Deploying

**Trial Usage Guardrails** - A system that:
- Limits free trial users to prevent abuse
- Tracks usage per action (projects, workflows, reports)
- Enforces monthly limits (3 projects, 10 workflows, 5 reports)
- Provides clear feedback on remaining quota

## üìã The 5 Steps (Quick Version)

### Step 1: Verify Database Function ‚úÖ

**Already exists!** The function `set_updated_at_timestamp()` was created in migration `00005`.

**Quick verify:**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'set_updated_at_timestamp';
```

---

### Step 2: Configure Netlify Environment Variables üîß

**Go to:** https://app.netlify.com/sites/app-startupai-site/settings/env

**Copy these values from `frontend/.env.local`:**

1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` ‚Üí Copy from .env.local line 4
2. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` ‚Üí Copy from .env.local line 5  
3. `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` ‚Üí Copy from .env.local line 9 ‚ö†Ô∏è SECRET
4. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` ‚Üí Set to: `https://app-startupai-site.netlify.app`
5. `DATABASE_URL` ‚Üí Copy from .env.local line 6

**Or use exact values from `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` (Step 2)**

---

### Step 3: Apply Database Migration üóÑÔ∏è

**Option A: Copy to Clipboard (Easy)**
```bash
./copy-migration.sh
```
Then paste in Supabase SQL Editor.

**Option B: Manual Copy**
1. Open: `supabase/migrations/00007_trial_usage_counters.sql`
2. Copy all contents
3. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/eqxropalhxjeyvfcoyxg/sql
4. Paste and click "Run"

**Verify:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM trial_usage_counters LIMIT 1;
```

---

### Step 4: Deploy to Netlify üö¢

**Already done!** ‚úÖ Code was pushed in commits:
- `4ad8716` - Trial guardrails implementation
- `039c152` - Production docs
- `2bcf174` - Deployment scripts

**Monitor:** https://app.netlify.com/sites/app-startupai-site/deploys

Wait for status: **"Published"**

---

### Step 5: Verify Deployment ‚ú®

**A. Test API:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://app-startupai-site.netlify.app/api/trial/allow \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"projects.create"}'
```

**Expected:** `{"allowed":true,"remaining":2}`

**B. Check Database:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM trial_usage_counters ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

**C. Verify RLS:**
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'trial_usage_counters';
```

**Expected:** `rowsecurity = true`

---

- [ ] 5 Netlify env vars configured
- [ ] Migration applied successfully  
- [ ] Netlify deployment published

## üìä What Happens After Deployment

### Immediate Effects:
- Trial users see usage limits enforced
- API tracks action counts per user
- Database stores usage counters
- Users get feedback on remaining quota

### Trial Limits:
- **Projects:** 3 per month
- **Workflows:** 10 per month  
- **Reports:** 5 per month

### Monitoring:
```sql
-- Check top users
SELECT user_id, action, SUM(count) as total
FROM trial_usage_counters
GROUP BY user_id, action
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Reset User Counters:
```sql
DELETE FROM trial_usage_counters WHERE user_id = '<uuid>';
```
